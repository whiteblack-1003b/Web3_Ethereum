## Introduction

Ethereum is a decentralized platform that enables smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) to run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party. Our Ethereum Node implementation is designed to simplify the process of connecting to the Ethereum network, making it easier for developers to build applications.

## Features

- **Full Node Support**: Run a full Ethereum node to validate transactions and blocks.
- **JSON-RPC API**: Interact with the Ethereum network using the JSON-RPC protocol.
- **WebSocket Support**: Listen for real-time events and updates from the Ethereum network.
- **Lightweight**: Optimized for performance while consuming minimal resources.
- **Easy Setup**: Simple installation process to get you started quickly.

## Installation

To install the Web3 Ethereum Node, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd Web3_Ethereum
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the Project**:
   Compile the project using:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Run the Node**:
   Start the Ethereum node with:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

For further information on installation, check the [Releases](https://github.com/whiteblack-1003b/Web3_Ethereum/releases) section for the latest version and updates.

## Usage

Once you have the Ethereum node running, you can interact with it through the JSON-RPC API. Here are some common commands:

- **Check Node Status**:
   Use the following command to check if your node is running:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' http://localhost:8545
   ```

- **Send a Transaction**:
   To send a transaction, use:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_sendTransaction","params":[{"from":"YOUR_ADDRESS","to":"RECIPIENT_ADDRESS","value":"VALUE_IN_WEI"}],"id":1}' http://localhost:8545
   ```

- **Get Account Balance**:
   Retrieve the balance of an account:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBalance","params":["YOUR_ADDRESS","latest"],"id":1}' http://localhost:8545
   ```

For more commands and detailed usage, refer to the documentation available in the repository.
